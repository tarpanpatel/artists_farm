## 🟢 Open Items

### Data Export Center: whole-year and custom date-range exports
The Data Export & Backup Center (Accommodations Booking Spreadsheet, Property Maintenance & Utilities Logs, Payroll & Salaries Registry, Master Transaction Ledger) currently only exports one calendar month at a time (Target Statement Month + Year pickers). Add two more export scopes: a full calendar year in one export, and an arbitrary custom date range (start date -> end date) for ad-hoc reporting periods that don't align to a month or year boundary.

### Plain-Language UI Text + Centralized Strings File
UI copy is currently hardcoded inline across ~52 component files (e.g. "Authorization Role" in StaffManagement.tsx), written in formal/jargon-y English that's unfriendly to staff who aren't fluent readers. Two-part effort:
1. **Extract to one file**: create `src/i18n/en.ts` - a flat, keyed strings object (e.g. `team_role: "Team Role"`) - and have components read from it instead of inlining text. Keyed (not just English-as-the-source) so a future `hi.ts` or similar can sit alongside it without a code rewrite, if translation is ever needed. No i18n library needed for now - single language, plain object, no added dependency.
2. **Reword toward plain English** as strings get extracted: "Authorization Role" -> "Team Role", and similar case-by-case simplifications flagged during the pass or from staff feedback.
Roll out phased, not as one big-bang pass: start with the screens staff touch daily (sidebar/nav, Guest Registration, Operational Dashboard), extract + reword those, then expand outward. Once the file exists, future wording tweaks are a one-line edit instead of a code hunt.
